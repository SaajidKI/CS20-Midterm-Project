This project is a fully static, multi-page website built with HTML and CSS that simulates a complete e-commerce experience. It features a homepage, product listings, a blog section, and a checkout flow, all connected by a consistent navigation bar and footer. The site is designed with responsive layouts using external CSS, and its modular structure highlights a solid understanding of front-end design principles and user flow.
